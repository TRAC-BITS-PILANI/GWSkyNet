# GWSkyNet: Pytorch
The main source of inspiration for this project is the paper by Cabero *et. al.* [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11829)

# Tasks 
[ ] Make Training Dataset input values using the priors mentioned in the above paper using Bilby package 
[ ] Generate the training dataset and add the noise inputs (Till here its common with the CNN we used for the Habbard et. al. implementation [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15ysgVLkekNNomT2xp3F0d52l_qNvGNfd)
[ ] Generate the skymaps of the training instances using the **BAYESTAR** package
[ ] Develop the model for the Network, make a few variations of the model for experimentation
[ ] For test dataset we use the ligo-gracedb package and extract detected events and test our model
[ ] Further, if possible try and improve the architecture or we can think of a new problem statement and adapt towards that
